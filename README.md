# PyDolphinWatch

This is an implementation of the [DolphinWatch protocol](https://github.com/TwitchPlaysPokemon/dolphinWatch), a text-based protocol to programatically control the [Dolphin Wii and Gamecube emulator](dolphin-emu.org). It wraps the functionality into a `DolphinConnection` object which offers methods for doing whatever the DolphinWatch protocol defines. Have a look at the [autogenerated documentation](http://rawgit.com/TwitchPlaysPokemon/PyDolphinWatch/master/dolphinWatch.connection.html) or [the code](https://github.com/TwitchPlaysPokemon/PyDolphinWatch/blob/master/dolphinWatch/__init__.py).

## Quick starting guide

You will need gevent and python3. Once you got that, here's a small example:

```
import dolphinWatch
import gevent


dolphin = dolphinWatch.DolphinConnection("localhost", 6000)

def connected():
    global dolphin
    dolphin.subscribe32(0x12345678, print)
    dolphin.write16(0x23432343, 9001)
    dolphin.wiiButton(0, dolphinWatch.WiimoteButtons.TWO)
    dolphin.save("C:/save.state")
    dolphin.volume(50)

dolphin.onConnect(connected)
dolphin.connect()
gevent.sleep(1000000)  # whatever is needed for the program not to immediately terminate
```
